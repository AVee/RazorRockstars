Showcase of new Razor and HTML support in ServiceStack's REST-Services Framework

Razor Rockstars is a ServiceStack demo website showcasing ServiceStack's new MVC Razor Engine support enriching 
its HTML story with multiple view engines and No Controller / No Ceremony web development options. 
In many cases we've gone beyond what MVC provides with many new and natural features optimized for developer 
happiness, fast iteration times and run-time performance putting the fun back into .NET / Mono web development!
